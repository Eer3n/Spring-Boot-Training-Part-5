Types of Design Patterns:
1.Creational,
2.Structural,
3.Behavioral.

Exp.
1.Factory Method Pattern
Purpose:
A Factory Pattern or Factory Method Pattern says that just define an interface or abstract class for creating an object but let the subclasses decide which class to instantiate.
In other words, subclasses are responsible to create the instance of the class.
The Factory Method Pattern is also known as Virtual Constructor.
2.Abstract Factory Pattern
Purpose:
Abstract Factory Pattern says that just define an interface or abstract class for creating families of related (or dependent) objects but without specifying their concrete sub-classes.That means Abstract Factory lets a class returns a factory of classes.
So, this is the reason that Abstract Factory Pattern is one level higher than the Factory Pattern.
3.Prototype Pattern
Purpose:
Prototype Pattern says that cloning of an existing object instead of creating new one and can also be customized as per the requirement.
